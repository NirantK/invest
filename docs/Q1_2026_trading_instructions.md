## Month 2 (February 2026) - Deploy $20,000

**TOTAL MONTH 2: $19,700**

## MSTR Ongoing DCA (Starting Month 1, Continuing Indefinitely)

**Setup:** Recurring monthly buy
**Amount:** $100/month
**Ticker:** MSTR
**Duration:** Until MSTR momentum turns positive or 5% portfolio allocation reached

**Calculation:**
- At current prices, $100 buys ~0.66 shares/month
- To reach 5% cap ($3,000): 30 months at current allocation
- **Action when momentum turns positive:** Increase DCA to $300-500/month to accelerate to 5% cap

---

## Detailed Execution Instructions

### Order Types

**Recommended: Limit Orders at Current Market + 1-2%**

Why limit orders?
- Avoid overpaying during intraday spikes
- Better price control on 3-month DCA
- Small positions may have wider spreads

**Example:**
- PAAS trading at $54.89
- Set limit at $55.50 (1% above)
- Order typically fills within hours to 1 day

**When to use Market Orders:**
- High-liquidity ETFs (AVDV, DFIV, IVAL)
- Large-cap stocks (XOM)
- If limit orders don't fill within 24 hours

### Timing Strategy

**Option 1: Monthly on Same Date (Recommended for Simplicity)**
- Execute all Month 1 orders on January 15, 2026
- Execute all Month 2 orders on February 15, 2026
- Execute all Month 3 orders on March 15, 2026

**Option 2: Weekly Splits (Better DCA, More Complex)**
- Split each month's $20,000 into 4 weekly buys of $5,000
- Example Month 1:
  - Week 1 (Jan 5): Buy 25% of each position
  - Week 2 (Jan 12): Buy 25% of each position
  - Week 3 (Jan 19): Buy 25% of each position
  - Week 4 (Jan 26): Buy 25% of each position

**Recommended: Option 1** for simplicity unless you have time to manage weekly orders.

### Brokerage Account Setup

**1. Enable Extended Hours Trading (Optional but Recommended)**
- Allows orders from 7:00 AM - 9:30 AM ET (pre-market)
- Useful if you want to react to overnight news
- Not critical for DCA strategy

**2. Set Up Recurring Buys (If Available)**

Check if your broker supports automated recurring purchases:
- **Fidelity:** "Auto Invest" feature (ETFs only: AVDV, DFIV, IVAL, XLE)
- **Schwab:** "Scheduled Trades" (ETFs only)
- **Interactive Brokers:** No native recurring buy (manual execution required)
- **Vanguard:** "Automatic Investment Plan" (ETFs only)

**For stocks (PAAS, HL, AEM, WPM, FNV, XOM, SU, MSTR):** Manual execution required at all brokers.

**3. Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRIP)**

**CRITICAL: Enable DRIP on ALL positions**

Why?
- Automatically reinvest dividends (tax-efficient for C-Corp)
- Eliminates cash drag
- Compounds returns over time

How to enable:
- Fidelity: Account Features > Dividend Reinvestment Program > Enroll all positions
- Schwab: Service > Dividend Reinvestment Plan > Enroll
- Interactive Brokers: Account Management > Dividend Reinvestment > Enable

**IMPORTANT:** Enable DRIP BEFORE buying shares, not after.

### Tax Lot Accounting Setup

**Set to "SpecID" (Specific Identification)**

Why?
- Gives you control over which lots to sell (if you ever need to)
- Minimizes tax burden when taking profits
- Default "FIFO" (First In First Out) is less tax-efficient

**Where to set:**
- Fidelity: Cost Basis > Default Lot Relief Method > SpecID
- Schwab: Tax Lot ID Method > Specific Lot Identification
- Interactive Brokers: Reports > Tax > Tax Lot Matching Method > Specific Lot

**Do this BEFORE your first purchase.**

**Account Settings:**
- [ ] DRIP enabled on all positions
- [ ] Tax lot accounting set to SpecID
- [ ] Extended hours enabled (optional)

| Ticker | Ref Price | 20% Range | Action if Outside Range |
|--------|-----------|-----------|-------------------------|
| PAAS | $54.89 | $43.91 - $65.87 | Recalculate allocation if outside |

**If any ticker is outside 20% range:** Re-run allocation script before deploying capital.

## What If Something Goes Wrong?

### Order Doesn't Fill (Limit Order)

**Symptom:** Limit order sits unfilled for 24+ hours

**Solution:**
1. Check if stock moved >2% above your limit
2. Cancel and raise limit by 1-2%
3. Or switch to market order
4. Accept slight overpay (DCA will smooth this out)

### Stock Gets Halted

**Symptom:** Trading suspended due to news/volatility

**Solution:**
1. Wait for trading to resume (usually same day)
2. If halt >3 days: Skip that ticker for the month
3. Reallocate that month's capital to other positions proportionally
4. Add back to allocation next month

### Broker Account Has Issues

**Symptom:** Technical problems, can't place orders

**Solution:**
1. Call broker support (have account number ready)
2. Place orders by phone (may incur $25 broker-assisted fee)
3. Accept the fee (DCA is more important than $25)

### Stock Converts to K-1 Issuer Mid-DCA

**Symptom:** Company announces MLP conversion

**Solution:**
1. STOP all DCA to that position immediately
2. Hold existing shares (don't sell, avoid tax event)
3. Reallocate future capital to other sector stocks
4. Update allocation script to exclude that ticker

### Negative Momentum Develops

**Symptom:** Stock's 3M or 6M momentum turns negative

**Solution:**
1. PAUSE DCA on that position (don't sell existing)
2. Reallocate that month's capital to other positions
3. Resume DCA when momentum turns positive next quarter
