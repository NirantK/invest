# US Portfolio Investment Context

## Investor Profile

- **Investment horizon:** 3 years
- **Volatility tolerance:** High (comfortable with -20% drawdowns)
- **Monitoring cadence:** Quarterly
- **Behavioral edge:** Ability to hold through drawdowns without panic selling
- **Entity:** US C-Corp (21% flat tax on all income, no preference between dividends/capital gains)
- **Tax objective:** Maximize after-tax returns; specific structure doesn't matter

## Capital Constraints

- **Total US investable capital:** $80,000 (over 18 months)
- **Minimum cash/treasury buffer:** $20,000 (working capital, always maintained)
- **Maximum deployable to risk assets:** $60,000
- **Initial deployment:** $20,000
- **DCA approach:** Monthly or quarterly additions

## Existing INR Portfolio

- **Total value:** ₹2,48,00,000 (~$27,559 at ₹89.99/USD)
- **Exchange rate:** 1 USD = ₹89.99

### Precious Metals Exposure (INR)

| Holding | Value (₹) | Value (USD) |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| Sovereign Gold Bond 2031 | 30,67,510 | $3,409 |
| Zerodha Gold ETF | 24,30,642 | $2,701 |
| Zerodha Silver ETF | 17,22,080 | $1,914 |
| **Total** | **72,20,232** | **$8,026** |

**Note:** SGB is tradeable on exchange with ~3% exit cost. Not a true lock-in.

### Other Key INR Exposures

- Heavy Indian banking/financials (PSU banks)
- 13.5% momentum factor tilt (Nifty 200 Momentum 30)
- Multiple ELSS funds (3-year lock-in)

## Allocation Constraints

### Precious Metals Cap

- **Target:** 30% of total portfolio (INR + USD combined)
- **Total portfolio:** $27,559 (INR) + $60,000 (USD) = $87,559
- **30% cap:** $26,268
- **Current precious metals (INR):** $8,026
- **Remaining budget for USD portfolio:** $18,242

### Bitcoin Exposure

- **Target:** 5% of total portfolio
- **5% of $87,559:** ~$4,378
- **Constraint:** Cannot hold Bitcoin ETF directly at Interactive Brokers (account balance too low)
- **Proxy approach:** MSTR (Strategy Inc) + COIN (Coinbase)
- **Preference:** Comfortable with large-cap Bitcoin companies only, no small caps
- **Deployment:** Willing to deploy Bitcoin allocation quickly (3 months), not slow DCA

### USD as INR Hedge

- All USD-denominated assets provide inherent hedge against INR depreciation
- Even XLE (energy) serves as India macro hedge since oil spikes hurt INR

## Investment Thesis Summary

### Oil/Energy (India Hedge)

- India imports 88%+ of crude oil
- $10/barrel increase → $12-13B higher import bill → CAD widens 0.3% of GDP
- Oil spike → INR depreciation → Indian equities underperform
- US energy positions profit from exact scenario that hurts Indian exposure
- Rick Rule thesis: $2B/day in deferred sustaining capex globally → supply crunch by 2027-2028

### Precious Metals

- **Gold target:** $4,000+
- **Silver target:** $50+
- Streamers (WPM, FNV) preferred over physical for operating leverage
- Streamers eliminate operational risk (no mining costs, diversified across 100+ mines)

### Bitcoin

- Expressed via MSTR and COIN due to ETF access constraints
- Will transition to direct Bitcoin ETF when account balance allows

## Instruments Under Consideration

### Core (Streaming - Fixed Allocation)

| Ticker | Name | Exposure |
|--------|------|----------|
| WPM | Wheaton Precious Metals | ~50% silver, ~50% gold |
| FNV | Franco-Nevada | ~80% gold, ~15% oil/gas royalties |

### Satellite (Miners + Energy)

| Ticker | Name | Rationale |
|--------|------|-----------|
| XLE | Energy Select Sector SPDR | Oil thesis, 0.09% expense ratio, India hedge |
| PAAS | Pan American Silver | Silver miner, Juanicipio catalyst |
| AEM | Agnico Eagle Mines | Lowest AISC gold miner, stable jurisdictions |

### Bitcoin Proxy

| Ticker | Name | Rationale |
|--------|------|-----------|
| MSTR | Strategy Inc | Largest Bitcoin treasury (~$40B BTC) |
| COIN | Coinbase | Bitcoin ecosystem, more conservative |

### Cash Buffer

| Ticker | Name | Rationale |
|--------|------|-----------|
| SGOV | iShares 0-3 Month Treasury | Working capital, DCA buffer |

## Excluded Instruments

- **Canadian energy (CNQ, ARC, Suncor):** Adds complexity, XLE sufficient
- **Uranium:** 5-7 year thesis, mismatched with 3-year horizon
- **Copper:** Correlates with Indian economy, reduces hedge effectiveness
- **Junior miners:** Require active monitoring, binary risk
- **Newmont/Barrick:** Poor execution, higher AISC than peers
- **Small-cap Bitcoin companies:** Risk tolerance exceeded

## Rebalancing Framework

- **Frequency:** Quarterly
- **Approach:** Dual momentum on satellite positions
- **Core (streamers):** Fixed, never rotates
- **Satellite (PAAS, AEM, XLE):** Rotate based on 6-month relative momentum

## Venture Debt Opportunity (DECLINED)

- **Offer:** $50,000 minimum at 18-25% XIRR, 18-month term
- **Counterparty:** India-based, expanding within Workday SaaS platform ecosystem by acquiring a US-based Delaware C-Corp
- **Estimated loss probability:** 5-15%
- **Decision:** Skip
- **Rationale:**
  - Single counterparty concentration (83% of deployable capital)
  - No thesis expression (oil/metals/BTC)
  - Illiquid for 18 months
  - Public markets offer similar upside with diversification and liquidity
